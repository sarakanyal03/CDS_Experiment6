AIM : To study and implement C++ decision making statements loops <br>
<br>
THEORY : <BR>
Loops in C++ are used to execute a group of instructions or a block of code multiple times, without writing it repeatedly. Some loops in C++ are as follows: <br>
1) `for` loop : It is commonly used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. <br>
syntax: <br>
```
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
2) `while` loop : It is used when the number of iterations is not known.
syntax:
  ```
 while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
3) `do-while` loop: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, with guaranteeing that the loop body will be executed at least once. <br>
syntax:
```
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
